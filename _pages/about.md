Hi, I am a fourth-year undergrad at the Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar, pursuing Dual Majors in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering. My research interests include `Deep Learning`, `Computer Vision` and `Domain Adaptation`. Recently, I have been working on 3D vision problems at [Dr. Shanmuganathan Raman](https://people.iitgn.ac.in/~shanmuga/)'s CVIG Lab at IIT Gandhinagar.

I have interned before at the University of Calgary as a MITACS GRI scholar at [Dr Roberto Souza](https://www.ai2lab.ca/team)'s [AI2 Lab](https://www.ai2lab.ca/home). I have also worked at [Dr. Mayank Singh](https://mayank4490.github.io/)'s [LINGO Lab](https://labs.iitgn.ac.in/lingo/) at IIT Gandhinagar.

Here is my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EdppXEkPUz6ylg-matg5mI1T5Lj_im88/view?usp=sharing). Feel free to contact me to discuss any collaboration opportunities!

Hi, I am an MSCS student at UMass Amherst. My research interests include `Computer Vision` and `Multimodal Learning`. I have also recently been working with `Large Language Models (LLMs)`.

At UMass, I am currently working with [Dr. Subhransu Maji](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~smaji/) on Image Saliency methods. I have also been working with [Dr. Chuang Gan](https://people.csail.mit.edu/ganchuang/) on LLM efficiency.

During my undergrad at IIT Gandhinagar, I have have been fortunate to work with [Dr. Shanmuganathan Raman](https://people.iitgn.ac.in/~shanmuga/) and [Dr. Mayank Singh](https://mayank4490.github.io/). I have also spent my undergrad summers researching at places like Caltech and the University of Calgary.

Here is my [Resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hEy6N3kn1NZr8Ykr5aVr7Lyv49qPSAk3/view?usp=sharing) (last updated: March 2025). I am always on the lookout for interesting problems and collaboration opportunities!
